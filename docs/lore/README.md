# Character Lore

**Furner** is a cat in a dog-dominated world. His life is a battle of balancing his mental health, very demanding boss and seemingly never-ending tasks. He enjoys eating good food and taking naps. For now he can luckily do remote work, but that doesn’t mean life would be much easier. Furner very much dislikes confrontation and can handle socializing in bits at a time. Long video conferences are draining and commanding clients doesn't make it any easier. 

**José** (Chihuahua) is manager at the local *Consultations Corps* and works as Furner’s boss. He might seem small, but his ego compensates for it. José likes to push his employees for best possible efforts. He dislikes tardiness and under-performing. And when he is unhappy, he will let you know. When a client is happy, Josè is happy. When tasks are done in a timely manner, he is happy.

**Steve** (Golden Retriever) is Furner’s happy-go-lucky colleague. He is the picture-boy of teamwork and could discuss anyone's ear off about his favorite things, like coffee. And squirrels. And coffee. Did I mention coffee? He probably should lessen his consumption of the life-giving liquid. Steve also likes to help his workmates. To give positive feedback and cheer those who to him seem to be feeling low. 

**Daisy** (Shiba) is one of Furner’s very few female colleagues. Even though she is a dog, she seems to have some feline-like features which makes her someone easy to approach for Furner. Daisy likes to chat about work and points of interests. Sometimes she will vent about Rocky’s shenanigans, but is also likely to listen about your problems.

**Milo** (Labradors Retriever) works at the Customer Service of *Consultations Corps* and is the master of defusing any possible conflicts at work. Can usually negotiate more time for tasks from clients. He is open for chat and helping, if he isn’t on a call with a client. Likes teamwork and a peaceful environment.

**Robert** aka **Rocky** (English Bulldog) has possibly worked for longest at the *Consultation Corps*. He has little to no tact and will say inappropriate things, mostly to Daisy and Furner. He likes coffee and taking breaks and very much dislikes if someone calls him by his government name. Rocky is also likely to get offended from someone getting offended from something he has said, and will always take a strong defence on the matter.

**Mrs. Montpawlier** (Poodle) is the CED and owner of *Montpawlier Enterprises*. Will expect superb service from everyone. Will stress everyone out. José thinks the sun shines from under her tail.

**Mr. Tailford** (Basset Hound) is working as Corporate Development Associate at *Unified Solutions Group*.

# Sprite-centric coordinate system:
# - sprite.x/y = sprite position (absolute)
# - hitbox = interaction zone relative to sprite (player must overlap to interact)
#
# Interaction states:
# - idle_interact: cosmetic animation after N seconds idle in hitbox (player hidden)
# - interact: functional animation when E is pressed (player hidden)
